# GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM

Google cloud makes it convenient to migrate on-prmises resources into cloud.
Google cloud console is easy to use and navigate.
This is documentation of some few commands I learned when preparing for Google Cloud Associate CLoud Engineer (ACE) certification.


## How to use the files
- Start with the files in this folder, [fundamentals](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/gcp-kickstart_lab_command/tree/main/fundamentals).
- Then explore the rest of the files based on  your learning progress
- Remember that you can perform most of the tasks in ```google cloud console```, with using the ```cammand line interface```
- Also, note that Google always update these programs, therefore double check to ensure the commands are still valid.


### Acknowlegement
I want to appreciate the organizers of [Google African Developer Scholarship](https://www.pluralsight.com/partners/google/africa/gads-2021?aid=7010a000002LUv2AAG&promo=&utm_source=non_branded&utm_medium=digital_paid_search_google&utm_campaign=XYZ_EMEA_Dynamic&utm_content=&cq_cmp=1576650371&gclid=Cj0KCQjw5ZSWBhCVARIsALERCvxQ31puYYlpeqSDwB7Qhd-LAK1J0ES4mo57QeJENtiXH2EmbWHgxkIaAhqlEALw_wcB). The program gave me the room to kickstart my learning into cloud technologies.
I also benefited alot from [Google Cloud Skills Boost for Partners](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/). Both program gave me access to google [qwilabs](https://go.qwiklabs.com/), where I learned and practice several labs on google cloud resources.
